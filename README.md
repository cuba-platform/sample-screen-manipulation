# Screen Manipulation

This project demonstrates how to programmatically manipulate screens in [CUBA](https://www.cuba-platform.com) applications.

* `CustomerEdit` screen controller defines dialog options in its `init()` method.

* `CustomerList` is a controller of the simple screen that contains a drop-down list of customers.

* `OrderEdit` screen controller demonstrates two ways of looking up an entity: from a lookup screen and from an arbitrary screen.

Based on CUBA Platform 6.1.1
